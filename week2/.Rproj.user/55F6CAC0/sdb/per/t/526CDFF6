When presented in random order, 9 pages out of 10 had more revenue when the font was set to comic sans. If it was really a coin flip for these 10 sites, what's the probability of getting 9 or 10 out of 10 with more revenue for the new font?\nA: This calculation is called a P-value. In R do pbinom(8, 10, 0.5, lower.tail = FALSE) lower.tail: if TRUE (default), probabilities are P[X ≤ x], otherwise, P[X > x].\n\n\nConsider the father.son data.
