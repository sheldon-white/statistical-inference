E[X] = expected value = sum(value * P(value))
E[roll of dice] = 1*1/6 + 2*1/6 + ... 6*1/6 = 3.5
E[fair coin flip] = 0*1/2 + 1*1/2 = 1/2

variance = V[X] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2
V[roll of dice] = 1/6 * (1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36) - 3.5 ~ 2.92
V[fair coin flip] = 1/2 - 1/4 = 0.25

variance of sample = σ^2/N


use pnorm to calculate probability of result, given number of samples, mean value and SD
Q: Suppose that the number of web hits to a particular site are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 100 hits per day and a standard deviation of 10 hits per day. What's the probability that a given day has fewer than 93 hits per day expressed as a percentage to the nearest percentage point?
A: round(pnorm(93, mean = 100, sd = 10) * 100)


Q: use qnorm to calculate quantile value, given quantile, mean value and SD
Suppose that the number of web hits to a particular site are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 100 hits per day and a standard deviation of 10 hits per day. What number of web hits per day represents the number so that only 5% of days have more hits? Express your answer to 3 decimal places.
A: round(qnorm(.95, mean = 100, sd = 10), 3)


Q: Your friend claims that changing the font to comic sans will result in more ad revenue on your web sites. When presented in random order, 9 pages out of 10 had more revenue when the font was set to comic sans. If it was really a coin flip for these 10 sites, what's the probability of getting 9 or 10 out of 10 with more revenue for the new font?
A: This calculation is called a P-value. In R do pbinom(8, 10, 0.5, lower.tail = FALSE) lower.tail: if TRUE (default), probabilities are P[X ≤ x], otherwise, P[X > x].


Consider the father.son data. Using the CLT and assuming that the fathers are a random sample from a population of interest, what is a 95% confidence mean height in inches?
library(UsingR)
x = father.son$fheight
> mean(x) + qnorm(c(.025, .975)) * sd(x) / sqrt(length(x))

Q: You flip a fair coin 5 times, about what's the probability of getting 4 or 5 heads?
A: sum(dbinom(c(4,5),size=5,prob=1/2))

Q: The respiratory disturbance index (RDI), a measure of sleep disturbance, for a specific population has a mean of 15 (sleep events per hour) and a standard deviation of 10. They are not normally distributed. Give your best estimate of the probability that a sample mean RDI of 100 people is between 14 and 16 events per hour?

A: standard error = σ/sqrt(N)
Here, roughly = to 10 / sqrt(100) = 1
CLT says that sample means are normally distributed, so what proportion is within += 1 sample error? 
pnorm(c(-1,1))
[1] 0.1586553 0.8413447
.841-.16
 0.681 = 68%


Q: Consider the father.son data. Using the CLT and assuming that the fathers are a random sample from a population of interest, what is a 95% confidence mean height in inches?

A: x = father.son$fheight
mean(x) + c(-1,1) * qnorm(0.975) * sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))
